## Overview

The Buildable Sets Application is a .NET-based web API designed to manage and determine which sets a user can build based on their current collection of pieces. Each set comprises various pieces, and users possess collections containing different variants of these pieces. The application assesses the userâ€™s inventory to identify all possible sets they can construct.

Features
* User Management: Manage user profiles and their collections of pieces.
* Set Management: Define and manage sets composed of various pieces.
* Buildability Assessment: Determine which sets a user can build based on their current collection.
* API Endpoints: Expose RESTful endpoints for interacting with users and sets.
* Comprehensive Testing: Ensure reliability through unit and integration tests.
* API Documentation: Utilize Swagger for interactive API documentation.

## Architecture

The application follows a Clean Architecture approach, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability. Key layers include:
* Domain Layer: Contains the core business entities such as User, Set, Piece, Part, etc.
* Application Layer: Implements the business logic and services like BuildableSetService.
* Infrastructure Layer: Handles data access, repositories, and external service integrations.
* API Layer: Exposes the functionality through HTTP endpoints using ASP.NET Core.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* .NET 6 SDK or later: Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed. You can download it from here.
* IDE: Visual Studio 2022 or later, Visual Studio Code, or any preferred C# compatible IDE.
* Git: For version control and cloning the repository.

### Installation
1.	Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nunosantos/buildable-sets-app.git
cd buildable-sets-app
```

2.	Navigate to the Solution Directory:

`cd BuildableSetsApp`

### Building the Application
1.	Restore Dependencies:

`dotnet restore`

2.	Build the Solution:

`dotnet build`

### Running the Application
1.	Navigate to the API Project:

`cd BuildableSetsApp.Api`


2.	Run the Application:

`dotnet run`

	3.	Access the API:
Once running, navigate to https://localhost:5208/swagger in your browser to access the Swagger UI for interactive API documentation.

## Main Logic

The core logic of the application resides in the Application Layer, specifically within the BuildableSetService. This service is responsible for:
1.	Fetching All Sets:
* Retrieves a summary of all available sets using ISetService.GetAllSets().
2.	Fetching Detailed Set Information:
* For each set, it calls ISetService.GetSetDetails(setID) to obtain detailed information, including the list of required pieces.
3.	Assessing Buildability:
* Evaluates whether the user has sufficient pieces in their collection to build each set using the CanUserBuildSet method.
4.	Mapping to DTOs:
* Maps buildable sets to BuildableSet DTOs containing only the set names for streamlined API responses.

## Key Components:
* BuildableSetService.cs: Contains the business logic for determining buildable sets.
* BuildableSet.cs: A DTO representing the set name to be returned by the API.
* ISetService.cs: Interface for set-related operations, including fetching all sets and set details.
* User.cs, Set.cs, Piece.cs, Part.cs: Domain entities representing the core data structures.

## API Documentation

The application utilizes Swagger to provide interactive API documentation. Once the application is running, access the Swagger UI at:

https://localhost:5028/swagger

## Key Endpoint
* Get Buildable Sets for a User
* Endpoint: GET /buildable-sets/{username}
* Description: Retrieves a list of set names that the specified user can build based on their current collection.
* Response:
* 200 OK: Returns a list of BuildableSet DTOs containing set names.
* 400 Bad Request: If the username is missing or invalid.
* 404 Not Found: If no user is found with the provided username.

## Testing

The application includes both unit tests and integration tests to ensure functionality and reliability.

## Unit Tests
* Project: BuildableSetsApp.Tests
* Framework: xUnit
* Mocking: Utilizes Moq for mocking dependencies.
* Key Tests:
* BuildableSetServiceTests.cs: Tests the logic determining buildable sets.
* Example Test: CanBuildMultipleSets_ReturnsTrueForAllApplicableSets ensures that only sets for which the user has sufficient pieces are returned.

## Integration Tests
* Project: BuildableSetsApp.IntegrationTests
* Framework: xUnit with WebApplicationFactory for in-memory testing.
* Key Tests:
* GetBuildableSetsByUserTests.cs: Tests the API endpoint /buildable-sets/{username} to verify correct responses.

## Running Tests
1.	Navigate to the Test Project Directory:

`cd BuildableSetsApp.Tests`


2.	Run Tests:

`dotnet test`
